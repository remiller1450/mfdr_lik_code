Figure 1 can be reproduced using either A or B:

A) Run all 6 .R files in the "Sim1" folder to generate the simulation results (warning - each simulation takes several hours), then run the code in "Figure1.R"

B) Move the 6 .RData files in the "Data1" folder to the location of your R working directory, then run the code in "Figure1.R"

Note: 
Running the files in the "Code1" folder requires the R packages "Matrix", "ncvreg", and "survival" 
Running the code in "Figure1.R" requires "ggplot2"

Figures 2, 3, 4, and Table 1 can be reproduced using either A or B:

A) Run Sim2.R file to generate the simulation results (warning - this takes several hours), then run the code in "Figure2-4.R"

B) Make sure the sim2.RData file is in your R working directory, then run the code in "Figure2-4.R"

Note: 
Running these files requires the R packages: "Matrix", "ncvreg", "survival", "covTest", "selectiveInference" and "ggplot2"
